# Olympus
_Reach for the sky_


Olympus is a cloud storage platform, written in pure go, and uses [Cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley) as its metadata store. Olympus is being crafted with the goal of being:
* Fast
* Private
* Secure

In its final form, Olympus will be a ReST-ful file system server and data store that lives on your private server and can be accessed from a variety of clients.
